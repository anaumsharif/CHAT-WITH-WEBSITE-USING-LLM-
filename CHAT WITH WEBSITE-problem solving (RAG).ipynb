Your teachers, tutors, professors, instructors will often give you problem-solving assignments as means of building up your life and academic competencies. Globally speaking, your entire education is built on problem solving, and here is why: when you are given a problem that ranges 1 out 3 on the complexity scale, you might not be able to deal with it at first.\\nHowever, with a little bit of help and knowledge, you are able to break it up into a set of smaller problems and solve them one by one. Eventually, you will be able to solve problems level 1 easily. Once you have reached this level, you will be ready to move on to Level 2 and the cycle will repeat. Education works exactly the same way: once you complete one problem-solving assignment, your skills grow and you are ready to move onto a more difficult one. The higher you are in this hierarchy, the better your problem-solving skills are and the more complex problems you can resolve.\\nTypes of Problem Solving Skills\\nAs a matter of fact, solving different types of problems requires a considerable number of skills, but they all may be divided into two main types: analytical and creative. Let us find out the role of these two skill groups.\\nAnalytical skills, which are also collectively called ‘logical thinking’, is a kind of thinking responsible for selecting the best solution out of all possible solutions. Analytical thinking involves the following skills: ordering, comparing, contrasting, evaluating and selecting.\\nCreative skills or creative thinking can be characterized as a thinking process, which creates a solution that is both new and valuable. The search for such solution is based on imagination, intelligence and cognition. Creative thinking helps to see beyond the obvious and plays an important role in solving the problem.\\xa0Creative thinking helps to see beyond the obvious and plays an important role in problem solving.\\nVery often ideas obtained in the process of creative thinking seem illogical at first. However, subsequent ideas may alter and modify the initial ‘illogical’ solution to the extent where it seems perfectly suitable. Such skills include some basic elements such as fluency\\xad, flexibility,\\xa0and originality as well as \\xadproducing uncommon ideas.\\nProblem Solving Pattern\\nEffective problem solving usually involves a number of specific steps. Depending on the situation and the type of problem, you will use one or the other problem-solving pattern. Nevertheless, we would like to offer a list of specific problem-solving steps.\\nProblem identification\\nAbility to identify a problem means that a person can adequately detect and recognize the problem, identify its source and nature. It may sound obvious, but this step requires more thought and analysis than it may seem at first.\\nProblem structure\\nThis skill requires the ability to observe, carefully inspect and develop a clear picture of the problem. When working on a problem, you need to find as much information about the problem as possible; as a result, you will build a more comprehensive picture of goals and barriers. This may not be needed for simple problems but is necessary for complicated ones.\\nIdentifying possible solutions\\nWhen trying to solve a problem you will need to identify all possible solutions and select the most viable of them. It works like brainstorming, where you name and write down whatever solution comes into your mind. The only difference is that your solutions are limited to whatever ideas come to your head, and that narrows down your choices. Nevertheless, you are still getting a list of viable solutions and are able to select the ones that you think are most effective.\\nDecision-making skills\\nOnce you have generated all solutions it is essential that you select the best one. This is perhaps the most complex part of the problem-solving process. Some solutions may not be possible due to circumstance like time constraints, budget, complexity etc. Evaluate all pros and cons and make a decision – which course of action do you want to take?\\nImplementation\\nThis step involves accepting and carrying out the chosen course of action. Implementation implies that you need to act based on the chosen solution. Implementation stage may bring some unexpected surprises; in most cases, they are a result of inadequate analysis of the problem.\\nFeedback\\nThe last step of effective problem solving is reviewing outcomes of problem solving. This step means that you need to make sure your decision was successful and effective. This can be achieved by monitoring and gaining feedback from people affected by the changes that occurred.\\nIn order to effectively solve problems, you need to be attentive, well-organized, flexible and motivated to find the solution. This level of problem-solving skills will require you to build up considerable experience in problem solving. Once you have dealt with a number of complex issues and have attained certain expertise in it, you will start solving most problems subconsciously and automatically.
